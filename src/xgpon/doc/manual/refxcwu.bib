	RCP is a congestion control with explicit congestion notification.
	
	The router calculates a common rate for all and allow new flows to
	adopt this rate immediately.
	
	Hence, when new flow arrives, network will be overloaded and queue
	will be built up.
	
	The system will be stabalized after the router find the correct N,
	the number of flows.
	
	During flash crowd, flows come in a short time and system may be not
	able to stabalize.
	
	This paper uses fluid model to investigae this problem.
	
	They use different parameters' value (RCP) and different flow arrival
	pattern/speed to investigate 
	
	in which case RCP can tolerate which load of flash crowd and the system
	can be stabalized again.},

	With the assumptions that flows backoff simultaneously (can be relaxed)
	and basertt is the smallest RTT sample ever observed,
	
	the authors argue that if \beta = \theta * basertt_cur / RTT_at_backoff
	and \theta is less than one, 
	
	all flows will finally observe their real basertt.
	
	However, due to rerouting issue, it is not a good way to use the smallest
	ever-observed RTT sample as basertt.
	
	If basertt can be increased by some way, their arguements are not
	correct again.
	
	This is why so many efforts are spent in Sync-TCP.
	
	In addition, the way of updating basertt may be improved.
	
	basertt(i+1) = \alpha * basertt(i) + (1 - \alpha) * basertt_cursample.
	
	\alpha should be adaptive too.
	
	\alpha may be quite large at the beginning so that basertt will not
	be increased a lot 
	
	due to cross traffic, the arrival of new flow, etc.
	
	If basertt_cursample is always larger than basertt(i), it indicates
	a reroute event occurs.
	
	\alpha should be reduced so taht basertt can quickly converge to the
	new real basertt.},

	Vegas-W is then designed based on these observations. Simulations
	are carried out for demonstrating its benefits.
	
	Shortcomings: In multihop ad hoc networks with extremely small BDP,
	is RTT still a reliable congestion signal (queue delay, contention
	backoff delay)? There may be less than one RTT sample in each RTT.
	So, why uses TCP Vegas? TCP Vegas performs better than TCP Reno because
	contention-backoff delay makes TCP Vegas less aggressive. Since FeW
	has reduced Reno's capacity probing speed, it may be better to apply
	smaller minimum window and smaller reset slow start threshold on
	FeW.
	
	BTW, the locality of traffic affects the overall throughput of the
	network. Why still establish an end-to-end TCP flow? 
	
	For file exchange applications, it may be better to transmit the whole
	file hop by hop with TCP, something like "Overlay TCP" and Delay-Tolerant
	Network. By this way, 
	
	the self-interference and interference among different flows can be
	minimized. In addition, 
	
	multiple copis of the same data can increase traffic locality when

	from other cross TCP flows.
	
	Combined TCP is then designed based on the following observation.
	
	1. when network is underutilized, packet loss rate is constant for
	each flow, 
	
	throughput is increased with the number of flows and RTT only reduce
	throughput linearly.
	
	This is the region that parallel TCP works well.
	
	2. When network is congested, congestive loss will occur and flow
	with long RTT will receive much less throughput.
	
	If RTT is doubled, packet loss rate should be reduced by 4 times.
	
	Hence combined TCP still use parallel TCP streams but a factor (phi)
	is used by these parallel streams to simulate a long RTT.
	
	phi=1, same with parallel TCP; phi=N, a compined TCP like TCP(alpha=1,
	beta=1-1/(2*N));
	
	When network is underutilized, parallel streams of combined TCP can
	improve throughput (packet corrupt rate will not change).
	
	When network is congested, since total packet loss rate (congestive
	+ corruption) will increase with the number of flows, 
	
	compared with parallel TCP, these streams (with long RTT) slow down
	their sending rate more quickly.
	
	As for stochastic TCP, an offspring of combined TCP, instead of use
	multiple TCP sockets, 
	
	only one socket is used and N virtual stream and phi is also used
	for fairness during congested period.
	
	Hence, the overhead of multiplexing/demultiplexing data among multiple
	TCP sockets are saved.
	
	Anyway, how to select N and phi, is still an open problem.},

	one RTT.
	
	Hence, even when probing rate is much higher, the period of congestion
	state is short.
	
	The problem is how to probe a high data rate accurately.
	
	If the sender tries to probe 120Mbps and packet size is 1500KB, the
	interval between two consecutive packets is 12Kbit / 120Mbps = 0.1ms.
	
	
	In the real operating system, I suspect that it is very hard to have
	a timer with such a granularity.
	
	There are some proposals to support micro-second timer. 
	
	But, OS should examine the list of active timers for each interrruption,
	system call, etc.
	
	The overhead is not negligible, and it may not or may take a very
	long time to implement these facilities in main-stream OSs.
	
	Hence, although it works well in simulation, I suspect whether it
	can work on the current OSs.
	
	As for friendliness, when they plot queue length, just one high speed
	flows are used.
	
	Only in the experiments for evaluating fairness, many flows (3, 2-100)
	are used, but queue length is not plotted.
	
	I don't know how the results will be.
	
	Another question is that, in Fig. 4, queue length is zero during most
	of the simulation time. 
	
	If queue delay is always close to zero, the senders can not get any
	network feedback (through queue delay).
	
	How could the sender adjust its sending rate?
	
	Finally, RAPID use one packet to probe a sending rate. Could one packet
	cause obvious changes in queue delay?},

  keywords = {wireless sensor network; data collection; mobile sink; collection
	tree update;},
  owner = {xiuchao},
  review = {In the context of data collection with uncontrollable mobile users,
	
	the authors observe that due to user mobility, there exist strong
	
	spatial correlations among routing structures at consecutive data
	
	collection
	
	positions. The authors then propose an algorithm, that uses local
	
	modification to reduce the cost of building collection tree while
	the
	
	routing performance is bounded and controllable. The idea is well
	
	motivated and the proposed algorithm is well analyzed. Testbed
	
	experiments and extensive simulations have been done and the results
	
	are quite good.
	
	
	Below are several questions that I concern.
	
	
	First, this paper assumes that at each data collection position, a
	
	virtual sink is designated and a collection tree is built up
	
	accordingly. I wonder that this scheme may have some adverse effects.
	
	For instance, mobile user may be able to directly communicate with
	
	several sensor nodes. With the above assumption, some neighbours
	
	unnecessarily use the virtual sink to forward data to mobile user.
	
	Some data will pass through more hops and collision becomes more
	
	severe nearby mobile user. For example, A,B,C,D are neighbours of
	
	mobile user and D is the virtual sink. Instead of sending to mobile
	
	user directly, data from A may follow the route A -> C-> D -> mobile
	
	user. Some simple mechanisms (neighbours of mobile user snoops
	
	acknowledgement from mobile user and stops the unnecessary forwarding,
	
	etc.) may alleviate this issue. But the optimal tree with virtual
	sink
	
	is not the optimal tree with mobile sink as the root.
	
	
	Second, according to my understanding, the initial data collection
	
	tree is first built up at node U and all the following trees are built
	
	based on the initial tree (through local modification). Assuming that
	
	virtual sinks (U -> V1 -> V2 -> V3 -> V4) are accessed one after
	
	another, it should be better if the tree of V4 is built based on the
	
	tree of V3 due to their short spatial distance. Of course, the
	
	properties of original algorithm may not be valid again. It may be
	
	worthwhile to study the scheme that optimal trees are built
	
	periodically (at different virtual sink) and local modification is
	
	applied during the interval (based on previous optimal tree).
	
	
	Third, more discussions are needed for multiple mobile users. The
	
	authors mentioned that for each mobile user, a collection tree is
	
	maintained. It is still not clear how the data is associated to a
	
	mobile user, whether the destination can be changed in the route,
	etc.
	
	Further studies may be worthwhile.

	It keeps TCP congestion control for TCP friendliness.
	
	Instead of retransmitting lost segment, a dummy packet (just the start
	and end sequence) is transmitted.
	
	These information can be piggibacked in other packets as a TCP option.
	Hence, bandwidth will not be wasted by transmitting old data and
	the effect on TCP codes is small.
	
	Last In and First Out is adopted for reducing one-way delay. Some
	evaluation results are used to demonstrate packet-reorder is not
	severe.
	
	Short messages will not be put into a TCP segment since application
	is the only appropriate place who know the semantic and the correct
	packetization way.
	
	This paper is better than TCP Urel (Ma Lin) to replace DCCP CCID-3.

	When SACK blocks tell the sender that three segments have not been

	If loss happens again when the sender is in slow start phase, cend

	It provides some numerical results in networks with multiple bottlenecks,
	
	
	 a large number of short-lived and long-lived flows, and variety of
	RTTs.
	
	Findings:
	
	 all high-speed TCPs are effective in improving efficiency
	
	 they exhibit different detailed characteristics. 
	
	When compared to previous schemes, 
	
	 CUBIC, Compound-TCP, and TCP-AdaptiveReno improve, to varying degrees,
	
	
	 RTT-fairness and Reno-friendliness. 
	
	Due to slow-start behavior of short flows, delay-based control is
	not very effective 
	
	 in improving RTT-fairness as expected. 
	
	Increase rule of TCP-AdaptiveReno is changed to be related with RTT,
	
	
	and it achieves highly balanced efficiency, friendliness, and fairness.},

	For rate estimation, the sample interval is increased with queue delay.

	When network is underutilized and the interval is small, the bandwidth
	estimation acts like "packet pair" and the estimation is close to

	Hence with agile probing (keep setting ssthresh based on the estimation),
	the sender can probe network capacity quickly in slow start.
	
	When network is congested (end of slow start), the sample interval
	is long. 
	
	The bandwidth estimation acts like "packet train" and the estimation
	is close to real received rate. 
	
	Hence, overshoot will not happen at the end of slow start.

	pseudo/tunnel interface is used. an agent (user level) that connect

	Address remapping is used to maintain a global routing table while

	The possible reason is that,

	If the buffer is too large, application may have not enough time to
