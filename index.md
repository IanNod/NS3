The ns-3 with CMake project is a modified version of the original [NSNAM ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org/) network simulator. 

The main changes are related to the buildsystem, replacing the original Waf with CMake, for the sake of using [Jetbrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).

Most ns-3 features are already usable with CMake, but python bindings and visualizer are still not working.

If you are looking for an installation instructions, check the [installation page](/NS3/installation)
